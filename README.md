# BLACKJACK
This is a simple and fun command-line Blackjack game built using Python. The project simulates a real Blackjack (21) experience, where the player competes against a computer dealer. It’s beginner-friendly, interactive, and helps understand basic Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and list operations.

🔍 Overview
The game follows standard Blackjack rules:
•The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
•Aces (11 or 1) are adjusted automatically to prevent busting.
•Face cards count as 10.
•A Blackjack (Ace + 10) is an instant win.
•The computer (dealer) draws cards until it reaches a score of at least 17.

The game starts by asking the user if they want to play. Two cards are dealt to both the player and the computer. The user can choose to draw another card or pass. Once the user stands or busts, the computer plays its turn. The final scores are then compared to determine the winner.

🎯 Key Features
•Card drawing using random.choice()
•Smart score calculation with Ace handling
•Game-ending logic based on standard Blackjack rules
•Replay option after every round
•ASCII art title screen for visual appeal
